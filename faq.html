            <h5>What is Revealr?</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">Revealr is a platform designed for consensual information exchange, especially for sensitive information such as school admission results.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="shadow-panel mb-3">
            <h5>How does Revealr work?</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">The initiator enters their information and sharing preferences, then sends a link to the recipient inviting them to do the same. The system cross-references both sets of preferences to generate a results page that is shown to the recipient. The recipient then sends a screenshot of the results page back to the initiator.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="shadow-panel mb-3">
            <h5>What does the results page look like?</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">Click <a href="https://kellenvu.github.io/revealr/results.html">here</a> for an example.</p>

            <h5>What are some use cases for Revealr?</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">Revealr is particularly useful in scenarios where mutual information sharing is desired but with specific conditions. For example, two friends who have applied to the same college might want to share their admission results with each other. However, they may prefer to do so only if both have the same result, to avoid potential discomfort or resentment. Revealr facilitates this kind of sensitive exchange, respecting each person's preferences and conditions.</p>

            <h5>Are my answers secure on Revealr?</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
                Revealr is designed with privacy in mind and does not store user data on any servers. This means your answers are not saved or logged anywhere, enhancing privacy. However, it's important to understand that the platform operates on a basis of trust and mutual respect between parties. Information on Revealr is transmitted via URLs, which are not encrypted rigorously. As such, the security of your answers largely depends on the integrity and honor of both parties involved. We encourage users to engage with Revealr in a spirit of goodwill and with respect for each other's privacy and preferences.
